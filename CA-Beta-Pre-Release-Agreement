License. The Product made available to you under this Agreement will be specified in the CA order form or similar document (the "Transaction Document").  If the Product is made available to you for installation, CA grants you a revocable, non-sublicenseable, non-transferable license to use the Product during the time specified in the Transaction Document ("Testing Period") with any hardware supplied by CA (if any) for testing purposes only.  CA may also provide you access to the Product and/or related information remotely (e.g., web session, teleconference, etc.) or via live Product demos.  

Restrictions.  The Product may only be installed at the address you provided in the Transaction Document.  You are expressly prohibited from using the Product in a live production environment, for development or for other commercial purposes.  You may not (a) copy, in whole or in part, the Product(s) (except for reasonable archival purposes), (b) modify, reverse compile, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, benchmark or perform competitive analysis on the Product(s) except solely to the extent permitted under applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver, or (c) distribute, disclose, market, rent, or lease the Product(s) to third parties, without the prior written consent of CA.

2.	Term & Termination 
Either party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Testing Period hereunder with reasonable notice. 
You may be invited to evaluate more than one Product or release from time to time via multiple Transaction Documents that will be governed by this Agreement.  The Testing Period for a Product will terminate at the earlier of (a) the end of the specified Testing Period or (b) when CA makes the Product commercially available. 
Within seven (7) days after the termination of the Testing Period you must either return to CA or destroy the Product and all related materials.  You may, however, retain a copy of the Product in archival format for a reasonable period should it be archived in accordance with your standard archival procedures.

You agree not to copy, disclose, publish, display or otherwise make available the Confidential Information, or any information gained from your use of the Confidential Information to any third party, except as expressly allowed hereunder, without CA's prior written consent.  You agree to protect the Confidential Information and any copies thereof in a manner consistent with your obligations herein, which in any event is not less than reasonable care. 

During the Testing Period, if you provide any materials or other information to CA, you warrant and represent that you have all the necessary rights to provide these materials to CA.  Notwithstanding the above, you shall not provide CA access to any personally-identifiable information.
